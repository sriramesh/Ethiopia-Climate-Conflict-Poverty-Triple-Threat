# A Triple Threat: Examining Poverty, Conflict and Climate Change in Ethiopia
 Since the end of the Cold War, Ethiopia - like much of Sub-Saharan Africa - has borne the brunt of a trifecta of development challenges: humanitarian conflict, climate change, and poverty. This paper examines which provinces in Ethiopia are suffering most from climate change, poverty, and conflict simultaneously using geospatial methods. This study develops and employs three metrics to measure poverty, conflict, and climate change respectively: (1) the 2020 MPI, (2) the number of fatalities due to conflict per 100,000 people, and (3) a simplified Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which uses annualized temperature and precipitation data to measure drought and flood risk. The techniques employed include map algebra to normalize historic annual temperature and precipitation data, resampling rasters, and spatial joins to generate Adm 1-level choropleth maps of Ethiopia on the three metrics. The study finds that no one Adm 1 region of Ethiopia ranks high on all three indices. The eastern Afar and Somali regions face severe poverty and high drought and flood risk, scoring high on both the simplified Palmer Drought Severity Index (values ranging from 0.3 - 0.5) and the 2020 MPI with values >= 0.5. The study also finds that the western Benshangul-Gumaz region faces high conflict and high drought/flood risk, with an average of 1.6 conflict-driven fatalities per 100,000 people and score of 0.65 on the simplified Palmer Drought Severity Index. These findings can be used to support policymakers and civil society in Ethiopia responsible for the geographic targeting of social programs (climate adaptation programs, humanitarian aid, cash transfers, etc) that could the trifecta of challenges.
